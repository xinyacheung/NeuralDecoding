# Experiment_one is to show the reconstructed videos using test data.

# Experiment_two is to show the reconstructed videos using masked data (where you could change masked region name [line 4 "experiment_name"] when running the code.)

# Experiment_three is to show the reconstructed videos using limited data (where you could change which limited data when running the code through changing name [line 4 "experiment_name"])

# Experiment_four is to show the predicted activity using Inverse Model.

# Feature_decomp is to show the feature decomposition results on brain data and model representations.
